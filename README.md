# TubeAnalytics

TubeAnalytics
This project, collaboratively developed with Aditya-s14, analyzes trending YouTube videos from 2019 to 2020. It focuses on uncovering patterns in user activity and determining which video trends peaked during this period. Our analysis utilizes various machine learning models to derive insights and enhance prediction accuracy.

## Project Overview
The primary objectives of this project are to:

- Analyze user activity patterns on YouTube, identifying peak and low engagement times.
- Examine monthly trends to identify when video views reached their highest and lowest points.
- Evaluate the performance of different machine learning models to find the most accurate predictor of trends.

## Key Findings
- User Activity Patterns: Activity significantly increases from 5 AM to 11 AM and is least active from 6 PM to 2 AM.
- Monthly Trends: The month of April sees the highest number of views, while October records the lowest.
- Machine Learning Models: The Decision Tree model achieved the highest accuracy of 99.61%, making it the best choice for predicting trends in this dataset.

## Data and Methodology
- Data Source: The data was sourced from trending YouTube videos during 2019 and 2020.
- Tools and Libraries: We used Python, leveraging libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data analysis and visualization.
- Model Evaluation: Several machine learning models were tested, with Decision Tree emerging as the most effective.
## Conclusion
- This project provides valuable insights into user engagement patterns and monthly trends on YouTube, supported by robust predictive modeling. The findings can inform strategies to optimize content creation and timing for maximum user engagement. Future work could enhance these models by incorporating additional data features or sources.
